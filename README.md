Invasive Ductal carcinoma(IDC) is the most popular cancer type in breast, and one of the most killing causes, however, if it is being diagnosed at early stages, there is high potential of survival. Though, IDC has been studied for decades, and pathologists have been trained to detect it from images, their accuracy is still relatively poor; on average it’s 75%. In this report We try to provide the society with some new trained models to help them deciding the malignancy state of the patient, and overcome the accuracy of pathologists in classifying the cancer.


The challenging part in IDC, is that it has no clear symptoms; Consequently women don’t recognize the cancer until very late stage of the cancer, where survival rate is very poor. In this report we will present some new models; that we have trained on IDC dataset. We will provide Literature review for IDC to see where the medical society stopped at, and deploy our models in MATLAB project, followed by discussing some ethical considerations relavant to our work.


We provide here via the report and two notebooks, full details of our work including literature review, and comaping our results and state-of-art results. We dicsuss at first what whole slide image(WSI) is, and how it's possible to perform such analysis.

Here is a summary of our results
